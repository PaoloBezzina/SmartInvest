# SmartInvest: An Investment Simulation Environment

This project was made as part of an initiative to help raise awareness about the importance of responsible money management for young adults.

## Description
The aim of this app is to educate yourself about the risks of investing blindly without any background knowledge of investing and to promote good investment practices. Although this is a simulation, it is based on real-life stock and cryptocurrency data and provides a next to life simulation which will help you to become familiar with the benefits, but also the unpredictability and dangers of investments.
